# hello and welcome to this

these are the solutions to the 2023 advent of code

i decided to challenge myself by writing all of it in pascal

i've never written pascal before this lol

but yeah
have fun stealing my solutions or praising me for writing the worst quality code you've ever seen

# building/running

every day has two parts, and it can be compiled and run with

`make dayXpartY`

where `X` is the day 
and `Y` is the part

the compiled stuff is in build ig

# python one liners

there's python one liners in pythonsrc.

just run em. there's no libraries.
run them in the root dir though

thankies.

# z80

i did day 13 in z80 assembly language too. it's in z80src

it uses zasm to compile and z80sim from [z80pack](https://www.autometer.de/unix4fun/z80pack/).

i edited z80sim to not print out that giant logo at the beginning but otherwise it's just the newest one built.
the binary is included though lol.

make day13part1z80 i think is the make for it.
output is in the hl register.
